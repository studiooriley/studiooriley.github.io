                        I love the Panasonic-Lumix GH4. While not as 
                        polished as the GH5, this camera delivers 
                        beautiful photos and videos at a reasonable 
                        price. It also records in 4K and sports a 
                        number of modern features like wifi, focus 
                        peaking, and multiple zebra settings. It’s 
                        only true handicap is its lack of an onboard 
                        image stabilizer.
