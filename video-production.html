            Looking for a crisp cut? Video editing takes 
            attention to detail, pacing, and just a little 
            bit of an X-factor. Turn your footage into the 
            best version of itself with Studio O’Riley.
        </p>
        <h2>Editing</h2>
        <p>
            I am trained in a number of video editing platforms, 
            including Adobe Premiere, Davinci Resolve, and Final 
            Cut. Each video gets the attention it deserves and 
            with my Complete Package Delivery Policy, you retain 
            the right to the edit file, not just the final product.
        </p>
        <h2>Color Correction</h2>
        <p>
            Davinci Resolve offers the latest in color grade 
            technology, offering node-based correction and mask 
            tracking for pinpoint fine-tuning. As it’s my preferred 
            editing platform, you’ll get a top notch touch up.
        </p>
        <h2>Motion Graphics</h2>
        <p>
            Studio O'Riley motion graphics are powered by Adobe After 
            Effects and DaVinci Resolve Fusion. With the right 
            plugin, you can build anything and make it do anything. 
            I consider it my job to take your graphics to the next 
            level with careful detail and smooth transitions.
        </p>
        <h2>Compositing</h2>
        <p>
            Green screens, masks, stock footage, the world of cinema 
            has it all. Compositing is about tricking the eye, and 
            doing it well. Need to replace your background? Add dark 
            sky and snow to a bright summer meadow? Using rotoscoping, 
            motion tracking, and a whole lot of technical mumbo jumbo, 
            Studio O’Riley will transform your scene into… a different 
            scene.
        </p>
        <h2>Audio</h2>
        <p>
            Ever been totally captivated by an epic video, only to 
            crash back to Earth because of poor audio quality? 
            Audio will make or break a scene every time. Whether 
            you need music, voice over, or the perfect sound effect, 
            we’ll work together to shape your audio landscape to fit 
            your needs.
        </p>
        <h2>Voice Over</h2>
        <p>
            I like to talk. I like it even better in front of a 
            microphone. If you need a voice for your video, I’m 
            right here.
        </p>
        <h2>Subtitles</h2>
        <p>
            Subtitles are important because they’re all about 
            accessibility and going the extra mile for your 
            consumers. In fact, some platforms and channels 
            require your content to include subtitles for 
            exactly that reason. Studio O'Riley goes the 
            extra mile, making sure your subtitles fit the 
            style of your video and that they don't interfere
            with other graphics on the screen.
